Basically, It adds support for selecting layers and moving layers by using keyboard.

This extension might be obsolute if aseprite add these functionality directly into the app.

Till that happens, here it is.

It cant select or move layers with different parents.

default KeyBindings:
<Ctrl + Up>    move layers up
<Ctrl + Down>  move layers down
<Shift + Up>   select layer above app.layer
<Shift + Down> select layer below app.layer

Have fun.
